# Predicting-Wind-Turbine-Power-Output-with-Deep-Learning
Using a LSTM (Long-short term memory) model to predict the power output of wind turbine based on wind speed and direction.

The data contains measured power output of the wind turbine and theoretical (max) power output to allow for comparision. The data was captured over a 1 year period. 11 months of data was used for training/testing the model (Jan-Nov) and then the final month (Dec) will be used to make predictions. The predicted vs measured power can be seen in the in the chart at the bottom of the notebook. 

All other code and outputs can also be found in the Jupyter notebook.
